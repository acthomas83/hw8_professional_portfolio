            Since the age of 9, I was drawn to computers and technology in general. As the years passed, I
            became
            very
            proficient using computers, particularly my Macintosh Performa 635. Before long, I began to wonder
            how
            it
            all works. With that curiosity, I found myself completely disassembling my computer and miraculously
            putting
            it all back together with no help at all. YouTube University wasn’t around back then. After many
            more
            years
            of self-educating myself on the basics of Information Technology, I landed my first IT job as a
            Technical
            Support Specialist at Philips. With so much exposure to technology and vital company systems, I knew
            that I
            needed to expand my technical knowledge through formal education. After reading about the Coding
            Boot
            Camp,
            I knew this would be the opportunity I’ve been waiting for to help me connect the many “technical
            dots”
            that
            I have collected over the years.
